This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the lower value cells (left side) and few in the upper value cells (right side). \n",

An example would be a state lottery, in which each class has about the same number of elements. It may describe a distribution which has several modes (peaks). If your histogram has this shape, check to see if several sources of variation have been combined. If so, analyze them separately. If multiple sources of variation do not seem to be the cause of this pattern, different groupings can be tried to see if a more useful pattern results. This could be as simple as changing the starting and ending points of the cells, or changing the number of cells. An uniform distribution often means that the number of classes is too small.\n",

If multiple sources of variation do not seem to be the cause of this pattern, different groupings can be tried to see if a more useful pattern results.

The primary purpose of bins in a histogram is to organize and summarize the data distribution.\n",
